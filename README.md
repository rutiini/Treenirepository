# Treenirepository
A backend service for hosting shared exercise data for the treenikello app

## ExercisesController

This controller is used to manage do CRUD stuff for exercises

## SectionsController

This controller is used to manage do CRUD stuff for sections

## Todo:
- Add unit testing and integration testing for the basic CRUD stuff.
- Figure out how the validation messages work, output messages are really poor for now (when using the ApiController decorator for automatic handling..)
- Add authentication for actual usage, Delete methods shouldn't be open for everyone.
